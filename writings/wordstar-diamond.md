I grew up with the WordStar diamond, and still use it today on Ubuntu Linux. Most people have never heard of it, so let me explain -- in short, it's a wonderful set of key bindings from the 1970s that makes navigating text much faster than with a mouse.

Back when the `Ctrl` key was where `Caps Lock` is now, there was a popular word processor named [WordStar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar). As Wikipedia says, it "dominated the market in the early and mid-1980s". It was [beloved by writers](https://www.sfwriter.com/wordstar.htm), arguably well past its use-by date. For example, George R.R. Martin, author of the books behind *Game of Thrones*, [uses WordStar](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2020/04/14/this-that-and-tother-thing-3/) for DOS to write his novels (as recently as 2020).

The *WordStar diamond* is the diamond-shaped, arrow key-like navigation the word processor used. When you held down `Ctrl`, you could use `E`, `S`, `D`, and `X` as arrow keys:

The beauty was that you could just move your left pinky a little bit, over to the `Ctrl` key (now `Caps Lock`), and then you could navigate the entire document without lifting your hand over to the arrow keys, and without reaching for the mouse.

`Ctrl-A` and `Ctrl-F` would navigate a word left or a word right. `Ctrl-R` and `Ctrl-C` were page-up and page-down, and `Ctrl-W` and `Ctrl-Z` scrolled up or down without moving the cursor.

If you prefixed a navigation key with `Ctrl-Q` you'd get the "quick functions", which would extend the key's meaning in a sensible way. For example, prefixing left or right with `Ctrl-Q` meant move to the start or end of the line, respectively. Similarly, prefixing page-up or page-down with `Ctrl-Q` meant jump to the start or end of the file:

There were other keys for selecting and copying text that used a `Ctrl-K` prefix: `Ctrl-K Ctrl-B` would begin selecting, and `Ctrl-K Ctrl-C` would copy, and so on.

These key bindings are great for writing prose, but they're also good for writing code. I love being able to navigate and refactor code without moving my hands.

At some point some horrible keyboard designers swapped `Ctrl` with `Caps Lock`. I'll never understand why -- to use 2.5 keys worth of prime real estate for a key you almost never use is Not Goodâ„¢. Thankfully there were (and are) ways to swap `Ctrl` and `Caps Lock`.

I'm just too young to have used WordStar proper. However, when learning to code as a teen I always used my Dad's [FE (Forth Editor)](https://github.com/hyblancode/fe). Keybindings were configurable, but the default was to use WordStar keys. Here's what it looked like -- ah, the nostalgia!

"But how do I use these amazing key bindings in 2023?" I thought you'd never ask!

My brother Berwyn created a set of scripts just for you. They're MIT-licensed, and available on his [**wordstar-keys**](https://github.com/berwynhoyt/wordstar-keys) repo. They map the `Caps Lock` key (right under your left pinky) as the WordStar control key, but leave the real `Ctrl` key available for normal use.

If you're on Linux, this uses the [xremap](https://github.com/k0kubun/xremap) key remapping tool. This works on X11 and Wayland, and I use it daily on Ubuntu (22.04 LTS). Installation is simple:

```
git clone https://github.com/berwynhoyt/wordstar-keys
cd wordstar-keys/xremap
./install
```

If you're on Windows, it uses the freely-available [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) automation tool. Installation is just a matter of installing AutoHotkey v1 and double-clicking `wordstar.ahk`.

**The brilliant thing about these scripts is that they allow you to navigate with the WordStar diamond in any program.**

I use the WordStar keys in my text editor (Sublime Text), my IDE (Intellij), my browser (including inside Google Docs), and even my terminal. One diamond to rule them all...
