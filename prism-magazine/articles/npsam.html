<h2>The New Perspective on Sam</h2>

<p>Tolkology is always one of those touchy,
almost religious, subjects: Tolkologists hate being categorised, and yet people
invariably put them into boxes. One of the latest Tolkienian schools of thought
has been popularly dubbed &ldquo;The New Perspective on Sam.&rdquo; Serious Tolkologists
and Fans alike have variously condemned and embraced this new way of
interpreting Tolkien&rsquo;s ancient manuscripts.</p>

<p>Certain things
must be clarified before we look at exactly what this &ldquo;New Perspective on Sam&rdquo;
is. Words such as Fundamentalist and Liberal are thrown around like balls in a
cricket game, but they have never quite been caught and held.</p>

<p>A
Fundamentalist used to be a Tolkologist or Fan (or even just a Reader) who held
to the fundamentals of the Tolkienian text. Fundamentalism began as an attempt
to flee from the prominent errors of the day. Its advocates held strongly to
&ldquo;straight-forward&rdquo; renderings of the text, and emphasised doctrines such as:
the inerrancy of the Canon of Tolkien (that is, <i>The Hobbit</i>, <i>The Lord
of the Rings</i>, and his other works edited by Christopher Tolkien); Gandalf&rsquo;s
bodily death and resurrection after the events at the Bridge of Khazad-D&ucirc;m; the
importance of Eru, the Holy One, to daily life; the corrupting power of the One
Ring; and the joy of eternal life in the Grey Havens.</p>

<p>With the coming
of television and other forms of shallowness originating from the United Shires
of Amari&euml;, however, Fundamentalism took on a new form. As a result, a
&ldquo;Fundamentalist&rdquo; has come to mean one who interprets Tolkien&rsquo;s manuscripts
literalistically and over-emphasises the importance of the individual. These
Fundamentalists only recognise <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>
as canonical, with the latter taking a far more prominent place than the
former, and for practical purposes even superseding it.</p>

<p>Most
Fundamentalists teach that the &ldquo;strong drink&rdquo; consumed in varying quantities
throughout the book was non-alcoholic, especially the Ent-draught. (Pippin&rsquo;s
antics at the Prancing Pony were apparently due to a &ldquo;Hobbit-like excitement&rdquo;
rather than any intoxicating effects his drink may have had.) By studies of the
original Westron text (the Common Speech during the Third Age), Fundamentalist
scholars believe they have found that the &ldquo;tobacco&rdquo; Gandalf and the Hobbits
smoked was simply dried birch leaves&nbsp;&ndash; harmless to the lungs and soul.</p>

<p>Fundamentalists
hold strongly to various other doctrines: that Sauron is alive and well in
Middle-earth; that we only have real certainty of going to the Grey Havens
after our coming-of-age at 33 years; that our faith in Eru hangs on a literal
reading of the phrase &ldquo;The Balrog&rsquo;s wings spread from wall to wall&rdquo;; and that
those over 33 will finally be joyously raptured up to the Grey Havens when the
High King returns.</p>

<p>A Liberal, on
the other hand, is a Tolkologist who interprets almost none of the Canon
literalistically, and who readily accepts the idea that Tolkien&rsquo;s great story
is not &ldquo;true&rdquo; at all, but really only mythological&nbsp;&ndash; people&rsquo;s attempt to explain
the mystery and morality of life. Liberals deny the bodily death and
resurrection of Gandalf (if they believe in Gandalf at all), and deny that
eternal life at the Grey Havens is more than a symbol. They accept many
non-Tolkienian works as being authoritative, and most liberal Tolkologists
believe the first three chapters of the Canon were really written by a Fan
thousands of years after the events occurred.</p>

<p>Liberals also
readily accept much that secular Tolkologists have to offer: that Legolas and
Gimli were &ldquo;rather close&rdquo; and almost certainly had more than platonic
affections for one another; that the dwarves were actually women, and their
large beards were not hair at all, but masks worn in an attempt to survive in
male-dominated Middle-earth; that the number of children Sam and Rose had was
unforgivably oppressive to Rose and her career choices; that King Aragorn
(Eru&rsquo;s Middle-earthly representative) was most probably a tall Afro-Amari&euml;n
dwarf with good rhetoric skills; and that Sauron and the Ring of Power simply
represent evil and darkness within the soul.</p>

<p>With that
clarified, what exactly is the &ldquo;New Perspective on Sam&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Ent E. Rite, a
prominent Tolkologist in literary circles, has been almost unanimously heralded
as the founder of the New Perspective. Rite&rsquo;s research into Samine Theory
(analysis of the behaviour, attitudes and writings of Sam Gamgee) has shaken
Tolkologists and Fans the world over&nbsp;&ndash; be they Fundamentalist or Liberal. Rite
himself says, &ldquo;I do not wish to stick to the categories present in traditional
Samine thought, nor do I wish to re-interpret the Canon in the ad-hoc manner too
common today. I wish to challenge Fundamentalists for their often-naive
interpretations of this Canon, and I wish to challenge Liberals for their
denial of most anything supernatural.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The focus of
the New Perspective is Sam&rsquo;s &ldquo;faithfulness&rdquo;, a Tolkienian word which has
connotations of friendship, loyalty, and trust. Tolkology has traditionally
said that the faithfulness of Sam refers only to Sam&rsquo;s loyalty to Frodo; but
with careful studies of the original Westron and Quenya texts and extensive
research into the historical setting of the Canon, Ent E. Rite believes that
&ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s faithfulness&rdquo; means much more than that. He believes it speaks both of
Eru&rsquo;s faithfulness to Sam, as well as Sam&rsquo;s faithfulness to Eru, to Frodo, and
to the whole Hobbiton community.</p>

<p>In opposition
to the Fundamentalists, the New Perspective stresses the importance of the
Hobbiton community as well as the individual. It emphasises the importance of
Aragorn&rsquo;s kingship over the whole of Middle-earth, including Sauron&rsquo;s domain.
The New Perspective denies that Tolkienian beer was non-alcoholic, and instead
promotes the idea that Aragorn is king over every aspect of life, including a
right use of both strong draughts and smoky leaves.</p>

<p>Over against
the Liberals, Rite Tolkology and the New Perspective hold firmly to the bodily
death and resurrection of Gandalf and the worth of the Grey Havens. Rite
upholds the authority of the Canon, albeit in rather different terms than
traditional Tolkology, and he is opposed to the &ldquo;nonsense about Rose&rsquo;s career
choices and Aragorn being a dwarf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rite&rsquo;s take on
Samine Theory has incited no small amount of controversy, even in the most
unlikely of places. Bruce Silkenskin, a leader in Amari&euml;n Fundamentalism and
author of <i>The Prayer of Lobelia</i>, says of Ent E. Rite, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s undermining
the cause of individual spirituality. He holds that Eru doesn&rsquo;t delight in
spirit-filled prayers like Lobelia&rsquo;s, nor quick-growing ministries like mine,
and he almost scoffs at the joyous Rapture of faithful Hobbits that may happen
at any moment. I am quite certain he is being used by Sauron as the
Antigandalf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the other
camp, Bishop P&oacute;ng, a left-wing Liberal Tolkologist, says that &ldquo;while there may
be some truth to Rite&rsquo;s teaching, he is largely irrelevant for a modern
audience.&rdquo; P&oacute;ng adds that &ldquo;Rite&rsquo;s teachings are still far too traditional, and
do not seek to help the hurting people in today&rsquo;s world. What does Sam&rsquo;s
faithfulness do to help the thousands of AYDS-stricken Orcs throughout
Middle-earth? How does it help the poor, lesbian Hobbits who are fighting for
their very rights? Yes, I believe Rite is wrong. He needs to show more
tolerance and understanding to the modern world. He must learn what being a
sensitive, Fourth-Age guy is really about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite the
criticism, Rite and others involved in the New Perspective have been rewarded
with an ever-increasing following among Tolkologists and Fans alike. Some see
the Tolkological benefits in a more community-centred take on Sam&rsquo;s
faithfulness, and some jump on the band-wagon simply because it seems to be a
solid middle-ground between Liberalism and Fundamentalism.</p>

<p>When asked if
he considers himself the founder of a movement, Rite responds with typical
humility, &ldquo;Not at all. If anything, I want to return to the Movement as Tolkien
originally perceived it. I stand, not as a Fundamentalist or Liberal, but as
one who in the strength of Eru can help Hobbits, Men, Elves and Dwarves come to
a better understanding of what it means to be the faithful people of Eru.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only Eru knows
whether this &ldquo;New Perspective on Sam&rdquo; is for good or for ill, and yet in the
meantime we Hobbits must be Beri&eacute;ns, always searching Tolkien&rsquo;s Canon, ensuring
that everything we read and hear matches what we have been taught. Whether we
consider ourselves Fundamentalists or Liberals, we must press on, looking
always for better ways to serve Eru and live as much like Him as Hobbits can.</p>
