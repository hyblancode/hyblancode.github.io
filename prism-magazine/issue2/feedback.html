<h2>Letters</h2>
<div class="author">to the Editor</div>

<h3 id='stillbabe'>Prism is still a babe</h3>

<p>We waited with eager anticipation in our household for the first <i>Prism </i>&ndash; it was certainly enjoyable reading.</p>

<p>Personally, I do have a few queries about some of the articles, but as you state in your edititorial, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t achieved all this in the first issue&rdquo;, i.e., encourging each other to think Christianly about all of life.</p>

<p>The magazine is still a &ldquo;babe&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;m sure it will mature with time.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great forum for gifted young (and maybe not so young) writers and artists to share their gifts with others.</p>

<p>We wish you and all the team God&rsquo;s blessing on this project.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><i>Frances Leibbrandt</i></p>


<h3 id='redaction'>So that&rsquo;s what &ldquo;redaction&rdquo; means</h3>

<p>Hi guys, great stuff!</p>

<p>Of course I&rsquo;ll subscribe to this. I recommend what is written wholeheartedly to anyone. It&rsquo;s fresh, inspiring, cool, and a whole lot more. I&rsquo;d say to anyone: you cannot afford to skip this magazine.</p>

<p>Redaction team: a job very well done and certainly a promise of what is to come. Keep it up! We need this kind of stuff.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><i>Jim Kloeg</i></p>


<h3 id='opposingzeals'>Opposing &ldquo;Opposing Zeals&rdquo;</h3>

<p>I must take issue with one of the more obvious cases of hyperbole in <i>Opposing Zeals,</i><i> </i>Genevieve Smith&rsquo;s article in the previous issue. As the mother of a small child, I have recent and continued contact with some of the organisations mentioned.</p>

<p>Perhaps it has just passed me by, but so far I haven&rsquo;t noticed their desire or any strategies to steal my child or dim her into a &ldquo;willing worker for the Government&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In fact, their stated aims are quite benign: educating parents in domestic hygeine, promoting breastfeeding, training nurses in taking care of babies, and my personal favourite &ndash; inculcating a lofty view of motherhood.</p>

<p>To demonise them is not only misleading and unnecessary to make the point that we need to take responsibility for our children, but is just the sort of rhetoric I would have thought a magazine wanting to appeal to anything other than conservative Christian right-wing enthusiasts would want to avoid.</p>

<p>On top of all this, I believe that Genevieve has no children of her own, though her article would lead you to believe otherwise.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><i>Kathy Bartlett</i></p>


<h3 id='thankyou'>Thank you</h3>

<p>Thanks heaps to all the people who contributed feedback for the first issue of <i>Prism</i>, and all those who subscribed! Also a big ups to editor Ben for his hard work and commitment! Our next issue&rsquo;s going to be awesome.</p>
