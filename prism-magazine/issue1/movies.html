<h2>Dead Poetesses Society</h2>
<div class="author">by Hyblan.com</div>

<p class="newsection"><span class="smallcaps">It was one</span> of those United Video &ldquo;$1 Tuesdays,&rdquo; and my wife and I finally settled on <i>Mona Lisa Smile</i>. We easily got a dollar&rsquo;s worth out of it, more because it was a great conversation starter than a great film.</p>

<p>In many ways this movie is just a female version of <i>Dead Poets Society</i>. (Not surprisingly, a quick Google told me I&rsquo;m far from first to notice that.) Set in the 1950s. New teacher comes to high-brow conservative school with new methods, new ideas, new vision. Tension. Relationships with parents strained. Teacher warned to tone it down. And the students love it. So far, so same.</p>

<p>But in many ways it&rsquo;s quite different. The main difference is that it&rsquo;s plain not as good. <i>Mona Lisa Smile</i> adds another whole theme, perhaps its main theme: the Fifties versus feminism. Except that it&rsquo;s more like stereotyped Fifties versus stereotyped feminism. The movie&rsquo;s a bit too pushy and politically correct to be a film that will last.</p>

<p>The history is a bit time-warped, too. The lead-role teacher (Julia Roberts) lives in the 1950s, but her wardrobe and her feminism, not to mention the Italian teacher who becomes her lover, could almost be from 2003.</p>

<p class="newsection"><span class="smallcaps">The movie</span> wasn&rsquo;t all bad. Schools and teachers often <i>do</i> suffer from lack of vision, and a passionate teacher can work wonders for students. For one fleeting moment during the movie I even wished I was an inspiring lecturer.</p>

<p>And there&rsquo;s a good scene where the head girl (Julia Stiles) states eloquently to the teacher that a wife doesn&rsquo;t mean a dead brain: &ldquo;I know exactly what I&rsquo;m doing, and it doesn&rsquo;t make me any less smart&nbsp;&hellip; to you a housewife is someone who has sold her soul&nbsp;&hellip; she has no depth, no intellect, no interests.&rdquo; The teacher almost caves in. Maybe she can tolerate marriage&mdash;just this once.</p>

<p>So go ahead: fork out a dollar, watch the movie, and then, if you&rsquo;re a bit weird like me, go have a Big Discussion about feminism, history in film, and agenda pushing. Or just find a copy of <i>Dead Poets Society.</i>&nbsp;</p>
