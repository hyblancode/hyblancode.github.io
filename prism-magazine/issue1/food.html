<p><span class="firstwords">Food is an essential part</span> of our day and one of the few things we need to survive. It ranks among the ancient greats of Air, Clothing and Shelter. These things don&rsquo;t have to be bare essentials&mdash;they can be <em>enjoyed.</em> In this column, I won&rsquo;t delve into fashion or architecture; I&rsquo;ll delve into food. And I&rsquo;ll endeavour to steer clear of extravagance, or suggest (like your typical column in a glossy magazine) that you use ingredients only found in France or Morocco.</p>

<p>I love food and I love cooking, but more than that, I love what comes with it: the art of hospitality. With each issue, I&rsquo;ll give you a taste of how a different culture enjoys food and hospitality, and I&rsquo;ll include some recipes to try at home. My mother always used to say, &ldquo;Anyone who can read can cook.&rdquo; That goes for guys too!</p>

<p class="newsection"><span class="firstwords">Having recently</span> been to Sudan, it would only be appropriate to share a recipe from that part of the world. Communal eating in Sudan is the done thing. Food is usually served on a big, round tray with many separate dishes on it. You seldom eat with a knife and fork. Instead, you scoop everything up with an airy round loaf of bread (or, in this case, Gorraasa, a flat bread) which you break into sizeable pieces to handle your food. You can eat a whole meal like this without getting your hands dirty!</p>

<p>I regret never writing down any of the local recipes, but luckily another Kiwi who was there last year did a good job of that. These recipes are courtesy of Mark Tanner, from <a href="http://www.marktanner.com/">www.marktanner.com</a>. The site is well worth a visit for more Sudanese recipes.</p>

<p>The recipe above is just one for you to try. It does not, of course, reflect the vast range of Sudanese cooking. Have a go, and eat it with the bread and your fingers&mdash;don&rsquo;t be tempted to use a knife and fork!</p>
