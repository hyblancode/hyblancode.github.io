<h2>With a Capital L</h2>
<div class="author">by Matthew Bartlett</div>

<p><span class="firstwords">I remember</span> about eight years ago standing on top of the
highest cliff above the river west of Masterton. The water
was clear blue at the edges and black and deep beneath
me. My friends were watching from below. No one had
tried the jump yet. All I had to do was start running and
I&rsquo;d be committed to the dive&mdash;and it would have to be a
run, to clear those rocks. I remember hesitating minute
after minute after minute. It&rsquo;s such a long, long way down.
Decisions and revisions. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ll make it all right,
the hard part is just to start that run. Now I&rsquo;m going to&nbsp;...
no wait, I better check once more that there&rsquo;s nothing in
the way down there. This time! Somehow I&rsquo;m over the cliff and
down and down and wet and my legs are on fire and
it&rsquo;s done, and I&rsquo;m alive, and now I know it.</p>

<p>That was a peak moment. They&rsquo;re gifts that come along
every once in a while. I want to live in the light of those
moments. Old people often tell you how short life is, and
how precious. I&rsquo;ve resolved to take that seriously, to live
as if time were short. But it&rsquo;s a battle. There is a crust or a
scab that forms, and I settle into the rhythm of my days
and ways. A week, two weeks, a month has gone by and
I might as well have slept through the lot. My boss tells
me that poetry is there to point us at what he calls holy
moments, those moments that make life worth getting out
of bed for in the morning.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to give the impression that this pursuit is a
feverish thing. It is true that some weeks busyness does push
down on me, and the weight of a thousand other jobs keeps
me from attending to any one task wholeheartedly. People
become irritating interruptions, disrupting my workflow.
But that cramming in isn&rsquo;t life with a capital L either. It&rsquo;s
something to be resisted.</p>

<p>I want to press my face up to the world and taste what&rsquo;s
there to be tasted. I want to look past the social veneer, at
least occasionally, and see the people around me for what
they really are: infinitely unlikely wonders all swimming
in a miracle sea.</p>

<p>Rabbi Simcha Bunam said, &ldquo;Everyone must have two
pockets, so that he can reach into the one or the other,
according to his needs. In his right pocket are to be the
words: &lsquo;For my sake was the world created,&rsquo; and in his left:
&lsquo;I am but dust and ashes.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>
