<h2>Silver Circus kids&rsquo; clothes</h2>
<div class="author">Angela Holtslag</div>

<p>When people ask what I do, I often say that I&rsquo;m a full-time mum and a part-time artist. But to be a bit more accurate, I make clothes. The artist bit (&ldquo;artist&rdquo; in the traditional sense) was kind of left behind when I was pregnant. Solvents and paints are super-toxic and messy.</p>

<p>So I spend my time hunched over a sewing machine and surrounded by mountains of fabric, with a mission to create original kiddy clothes. They&rsquo;re often unisex, or at least are not all pink flowers for girls and blue trucks for boys. I use vintage fabrics and natural fibres (including hand-dyed hemp and handmade felt), and I dabble in screen-printing (mainly New Zealand plants such as cabbage trees, flax, kowhai and nikau palms).</p>

<p>I make children&rsquo;s clothes because they are smaller and faster to make. They use less fabric, and I feel I&rsquo;m getting more done in the limited time I have &ndash; before my gorgeous girl settles herself on my knee to play with the moving needle.</p>

<p>Recently I set up a business for making and selling the clothes under the label <i>Silver Circus</i>. I work from a studio space at home (the biggest room of the house) and sell my work mainly at markets, fairs, and boutique shops. The main fuel for <i>Silver Circus</i> is not the possible income, it&rsquo;s more the expression of creativity. I have a constant desire to be creating something and, according to my mum, always have had. </p>

<p>If I&rsquo;m not sewing, designing or printing, I find myself feeling a kind of unconstructive uselessness, or hanging the washing in rainbow sequence, or making muffins with a bizarre mix of ingredients, or just getting <i>too</i> into Lucy&rsquo;s play dough.</p>

<p>I just <i>have</i> to be doing something. Sitting on the couch watching TV or reading a novel gives me pangs of guilt about not doing anything practical. I have an itch to sew, and the only way I can afford it is to sell it. </p>
