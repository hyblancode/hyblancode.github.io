<h2>Ambivalence</h2>
<div class="author">by Joanna Beresford</div>

<p>T<span class="firstwords">he old man</span> at number forty-two waved at me. I&rsquo;d seen him before as I marched home from the station. This evening, instead of sitting on the porch, he was in the garden pruning his camellia tree.</p>

<p>We always smiled or nodded a greeting at each other, nothing more, just a salute between strangers. But now here he was ambling slowly towards the gate with a flower raised in his right hand and secateurs in the other.</p>

<img class="right" src="images/ambivalence.jpg" width="200" height="266" alt="Old man sitting on bench" title="No, he's not the man at number forty-two">

<p>&ldquo;Nice day we&rsquo;re havin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>I reluctantly slowed down to agree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bit dry though,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Me garden&rsquo;s dyin&rsquo; off. Shame to see the camellias all brownin&rsquo; up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mm,&rdquo; I replied, not happy to have my routine broken. &ldquo;Your garden still looks nice though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, not really the same since me wife died. She used to take care of that sort of thing. A real green thumb, she was.&rdquo; He smiled wistfully at the flower in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that,&rdquo; I mumbled dutifully.</p>

<p>He looked up quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be, love. That&rsquo;s life isn&rsquo;t it? Some might call me lucky &hellip; Are you looking forward to Christmas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Christmas was three days away. My last day of work was tomorrow and then I could start looking forward to a week of sleep-ins, barbeques and drinking some wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; I smiled in spite of my impatience. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re spending it with my husband&rsquo;s side this year.&rdquo; I hesitated, feeling myself inadvertently drawn into conversation. &ldquo;How about yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not up to much. I&rsquo;ll just be here.&rdquo; The old man absently swept his arm up towards the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any family coming around?&rdquo; I delved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, me daughter&rsquo;s family is up in North Queensland and I don&rsquo;t see much of me son these days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to make a nice dinner then, to celebrate,&rdquo; I said, attempting to crack the awkwardness of the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nah, probably just have the usual sandwiches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Horrified, I searched his creased expression for traces of self-pity. There were none. He smiled again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, I&rsquo;ve had some good Christmases, I&rsquo;ve got me memories. Here,&rdquo; he extended his arm, crackled and sun-spotted, pushing the camellia into my hand. &ldquo;A pretty flower for a pretty girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; I took his offering and inhaled the delicate fragrance. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better be going,&rdquo; I said slowly. Suddenly I wanted to carefully wrap this fragile old man up and take him away with me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Karen by the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Pleased to meet you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bye then.&rdquo; I began to wander slowly up the footpath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas, cheerio.&rdquo; He went back to his pruning while twenty steps away I walked on, fighting back tears. Could I ask him to the family Christmas dinner?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; My conscience screamed.</p>

<p>But my husband&rsquo;s family? Would they think I was completely mad, inviting a stranger into their home? Their Christmas was entwined with their own traditions. Too many presents and plenty of barbequed prawns. How could it possibly work?</p>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to ask. </p>

<p>I stopped and began to walk back the way I&rsquo;d just come. </p>

<p>Paused again and stared over the lawns, just glimpsing the top of the camellia tree. </p>

<p>I swung back in the direction of my own house. </p>

<p>And kept walking. </p>
