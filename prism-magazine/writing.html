<h2>Writing guide</h2>

<h3 id="talent">Talent wanted</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re always on the lookout for good writers, story-tellers
and poets. If you can write prose or poetry, or you know someone that
can, <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to
be great to write for <i>Prism</i>&mdash;just send us what you&rsquo;ve got.
We&rsquo;re keen not just to publish masters, but to help average
writers get better.</p>


<h3 id="what">What to write?</h3>

<p>Quite simply, you can write about whatever you&rsquo;re good at
or interested in. That said, we have definite ideas for some of our
columns. Please tell us if you want to be part of any of them:</p>

<ul class="big">

<li><strong>Culture:</strong> movies, books, music,
history, science. We&rsquo;d like to discuss both popular and
classical works, and attempt to shrink the divide between these
two worlds.</li>

<li><strong>Home life.</strong> Stories and thoughts on various
aspects of home and community life: family, food and fences.</li>

<li><strong>Work.</strong> Articles by people with a good amount
of life experience writing about how and why they value their
work. (Inspired by <a href="http://wrf.ca/comment/">Comment</a>
magazine.)</li>

<li><strong>Politics</strong> often seems like one dog biting another,
but we don&rsquo;t think it has to be that way. We want to encourage
thoughtful politics through thoughtful writing.</li>

<li><strong>Interviews</strong> with people outside our comfort
zone, or with people who don&rsquo;t agree with our vision.</li>

<li><strong>Poetry and stories.</strong> We know there&rsquo;s a
lot of poetic and story-telling talent out there, and we&rsquo;re
keen to see it.</li>

<li><strong>Sport.</strong> A general sports column, with side
features on cars as well as weird or extreme sports. Talk to us if you
want to write or be interviewed about your extreme sport, or if you
have (or had) a car about which you can spin a yarn.</li>

</ul>


<a name="style"></a><h3>Style</h3>

<p>Because <i>Prism</i> is aimed at real people, we encourage writers
to be clear, engaging, and free from jargon. Not woodenly direct,
but certainly not stuff that&rsquo;s come from
<a href="http://www.elsewhere.org/pomo/">The
Postmodernism Generator</a>. We believe language is a gift from
God, that it can communicate clearly, and that using it is a
craft like any other.</p>

<p>You can write either non-fiction or fiction, but articles
don&rsquo;t have to fit neatly into either category. Humour, wit
and satire are welcomed, as long as their use doesn&rsquo;t
go against the rest of our vision.</p>

<p>Interesting material and good flow is more important than
perfect spelling. <i>Prism</i>&rsquo;s editors can catch bad spelling
and grammar, but bad form and flow are much harder to correct.</p>

<p>Writers need to keep sharpening themselves. Read a lot. Write
a lot. Bounce your ideas off people that care. Read good books like
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321095170/">Style:
Ten Lessons in Clarity and Grace</a> by Joseph M.&nbsp;Williams and
essays such as
<a href="http://eserver.org/langs/politics-english-language.txt">Politics
and the English Language</a> by George Orwell. And those are just
two examples; there&rsquo;s plenty of good writing on writing out there,
both about fiction and non-fiction.</p>


<a name="publishing"></a><h3>Publishing</h3>

<p>If at all possible, articles published in <i>Prism</i> should not be
published elsewhere at the same time. In other words, if you write
a piece for <i>Prism</i>, don&rsquo;t post the article on your blog till
after the <em>next</em> issue of the magazine comes out.</p>
