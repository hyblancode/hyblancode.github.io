<h2>Our vision</h2>


<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>A good crop of <a href="people.html">us</a> have been dreaming
for a while now about &ldquo;publishing something.&rdquo; Every so
often some well-meaning person will nod and say, &ldquo;Yeah,
that&rsquo;s a good idea.&rdquo; But no one does.</p>

<p>People have more than enough to read, but so much of it&rsquo;s
junky, shallow, irrelevant, or just plain boring. We believe
there&rsquo;s enough need for a magazine, we believe there&rsquo;s
enough desire, and we believe there&rsquo;s enough talent. So here
we are, publishing <i>Prism</i>.</p>

<p>But what is the &ldquo;something&rdquo; we want to publish?
Almost anything we&rsquo;re doing, interested in, or want to write
about. We don&rsquo;t want to limit ourselves to a fixed topic, but
we do want <i>Prism</i> held together by quality local talent.</p>

<p>The idea is to start where we are, with the talent we&rsquo;ve
got. Because most of us are youngish and associated with the
<a href="http://www.rcnz.org.nz/">Reformed Churches of New Zealand (RCNZ)</a>,
our initial target audience will be youngish RCNZers. And if we
grow from there, all the better.</p>


<h3 id="christ">Christianity</h3>

<p>Despite the core group being unashamed Christians, <i>Prism</i>
isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;Christian magazine&rdquo; in the
usual sense. It&rsquo;s not a Church magazine, a theology
magazine, or even a youth group magazine. Instead, <i>Prism</i> is a
magazine thoughtfully put together by people with a
Christian vision.</p>

<p>We publish articles about
<a href="writing.html#what">most anything</a> in life, the
kinds of things our readers do and enjoy. This means the kind of
diversity we see each day: from computers to gardening, from
theology to satire, from music to marriage, from Church to cars,
from movies to food. We believe that if we can do all these
things, then we can do them Christianly.</p>

<p>Articles don&rsquo;t have to be &ldquo;religious&rdquo; to be
considered. In fact, we believe there are more than enough
religious journals on the magazine market already, and
perhaps steering clear of this emphasis on &ldquo;spiritual
things&rdquo; for a while would do us good. That said, we are
not at all shy about our Christian faith, but we try to treat
it as part of the very fabric of our writing.</p>

<p>We want a Christian outlook that&rsquo;s broad but not
waffly, a kind of big-hearted orthodoxy. We treat the Scriptures
with utmost respect. We respect the history of the Church,
seeing ourselves as part of the Church through the ages. We
want to drink deeply from our Reformed heritage, but allow
ourselves to apply thoughtful critique where necessary. We
will quote Calvin as easily as Chesterton.</p>

<p>In all this, we hope that <i>Prism</i> will be the kind of magazine
we&rsquo;ll not be ashamed to give our unbelieving friends or
agnostic workmates. If God sees fit, maybe more people will
serve Him because of it.</p>


<h3 id="localtalent">Local Talent</h3>

<p>We encourage &ldquo;localness&rdquo; and &ldquo;local
talent&rdquo; with <i>Prism</i>&rsquo;s content and with its
distribution. The articles are largely written by Kiwis, and
they often directly encourage interaction with the community,
whether it be hospitality to the people next-door,
or helping your church reach out to the needy people down the
road.</p>

<p>W. H. Auden described what&rsquo;s also our goal for <i>Prism</i>,
&ldquo;A poet&rsquo;s hope: to be, like some valley cheese,
local, but prized elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A large part of our vision is to encourage creativity among
our readers. We encourage those we know who are talented
writers or artists to publish poetry, prose, and picture. We
promote not art for art&rsquo;s sake, but the fusion of work
and art, as God did in the universe&rsquo;s first six days.
This is the same God who now gives us callings, not merely
jobs.</p>


<h3 id="magazinecontent">Content</h3>

<p><i>Prism</i> doesn&rsquo;t shy away from unusual articles, or
from columns that are unusual in a magazine produced by
Christians. We often draw ideas for columns from various
other magazines which have influenced the editors:
<a href="http://www.credenda.org/">Credenda/Agenda</a>,
<a href="http://wrf.ca/comment/">Comment</a>,
<a href="http://www.caelumetterra.com/">Caelum Et Terra</a>,
<a href="http://www.highlandsstudycenter.org/ETC/ETC.html">Every Thought Captive</a>, and
Antithesis, to name a few.</p>

<p>Some of the
<a href="writing.html#what">topics</a> we will include as regular
columns: book, movie and music reviews; family and food; work
and craftsmanship; politics; interviews; poetry, anecdotes and
short stories; sport; cars.</p>

<p>For more information about writing style, please read our
<a href="writing.html">writing guide</a>.</p>


<h3 id="medium">Medium</h3>

<p><i>Prism</i> is primarily a <em>printed</em> magazine. Apart from
being plain nicer to read, a printed magazine can be hugged and held,
given to friends and co-workers, thrown on the coffee table, and
discussed over a beer. In short, this fits with our thinking that
we are real people who do real things, talk with real people, and
publish real magazines.</p>

<p>To give people a taste for the content, we&rsquo;ll publish selected
articles from each issue on this website. And after the next printed
issue comes out, we&rsquo;ll make the whole previous issue available
on the web.</p>

<p>Alongside the printed magazine, here on the web we hope to publish
more in-depth articles, as well as links to further information.
We&rsquo;ll also be starting an online discussion forum to
complement the magazine&rsquo;s letters to the editor.</p>


<h3 id="proposal">The Proposal</h3>

<p>Just for the record, we&rsquo;ve put online the
<a href="proposal.html">original proposal</a> for what
became <i>Prism</i>. It was written by Hyblan.com in February 2005.</p>
