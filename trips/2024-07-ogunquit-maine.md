**Introduction**
Few places capture the essence of a New England summer quite like Ogunquit, Maine. With its charming downtown, scenic walking trails, sandy beaches, and oceanfront dining, Ogunquit is the kind of place that makes you feel like you're in a postcard. This past July, we set out for a sunny day trip to this beloved coastal town, and it delivered everything we could have hoped for — salty air, lobster rolls, and plenty of seaside charm. Whether you're visiting for the first time or returning to an old favorite, Ogunquit in summer is always a good idea.

**Getting There and Parking Tips**
Located just 30 minutes north of Portsmouth, Ogunquit is an easy and scenic drive from the Seacoast. We arrived mid-morning and parked at the Main Beach municipal lot, which gave us great access to the beach and a quick walk into town. (Tip: In peak summer, lots can fill up fast, so arriving early is a smart move.) There are several paid lots throughout town, and the trolley system is a fun and efficient way to get around if you're hopping between neighborhoods.

**Morning on Marginal Way**
We started our day with a walk along the iconic Marginal Way, a mile-long coastal path that stretches from Ogunquit Beach to Perkins Cove. The trail hugs the rocky shoreline and offers endless ocean views, benches to rest on, and plenty of photo ops. In July, the wildflowers along the path were in full bloom, and the salty breeze off the Atlantic was the perfect companion.

This walk is family-friendly and not strenuous, but bring sunscreen — there's little shade. We took our time strolling the path and ended at Perkins Cove, a charming little harbor lined with boutiques, lobster shacks, and art galleries.

**Perkins Cove and Lunch**
After browsing a few local shops, we grabbed lunch at Lobster Shack, a laid-back spot right on the water. The lobster roll — overflowing with fresh meat and just a touch of mayo — was a summer classic. We found a picnic table with a view of the boats bobbing in the harbor and watched the historic drawbridge open for passing vessels. There's a relaxed, old-school vibe in Perkins Cove that makes you want to linger.

If you're in the mood for a sit-down meal, Barnacle Billy's is another long-time favorite with great views and cold lemonade.

**Afternoon at Ogunquit Beach**
In the afternoon, we headed back to Ogunquit Beach, one of the most beautiful stretches of sand in southern Maine. The beach is wide, clean, and has gentle surf — perfect for families and casual swimmers. At low tide, you can walk out forever, and little tidal pools make it extra fun for younger kids.

We rented a beach umbrella from a local stand and set up camp for a few hours of swimming, sandcastle building, and pure seaside relaxation. The water in July is chilly but refreshing, especially after a warm walk along Marginal Way.

**Downtown Strolling and Ice Cream**
Before heading home, we explored downtown Ogunquit, a walkable stretch filled with boutiques, bookshops, and cafes. It's a great spot to browse for souvenirs, pick up a locally made candle or t-shirt, or just people-watch. For a sweet treat, we stopped at Sweet Pea's Ice Cream, where the homemade blueberry ice cream was an instant favorite.

If you're staying into the evening, Ogunquit is known for its playhouse theater and lively restaurant scene. But even just spending the day here feels like a mini vacation.

**Travel Tips for Ogunquit in July**
- **Timing**: Arrive early to beat traffic and secure parking. Ogunquit is a popular spot in summer, and weekends can get crowded.
- **Footwear**: Bring comfortable shoes for walking Marginal Way, and sandals for the beach.
- **Trolley**: The Ogunquit trolley system is an easy and fun way to get between the beach, Perkins Cove, and downtown.
- **Dining**: Popular spots like Lobster Shack and Barnacle Billy's can have lines during lunch. Going early or late helps.
- **What to Bring**: Beach towels, sunscreen, water bottles, and a camera — you'll want to capture the views.

Whether you're walking the Marginal Way or digging your toes into the sand, Ogunquit offers a slice of Maine that feels timeless.
