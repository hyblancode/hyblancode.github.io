**Introduction**
After a long New England winter, nothing sounded better than sunshine, open skies, and a change of scenery. This past April, we packed our bags for a 10-day adventure that combined two very different — but equally stunning — destinations: the red rock canyons of Sedona, Arizona, and the breezy, beachy charm of San Diego, California. From desert hikes and vortex energy to coastal sunsets and zoo visits, this trip offered the best of both worlds. Here's a full recap of our journey, with highlights, tips, and favorite stops to help you plan your own Southwest-to-West Coast getaway.

**Part 1: Sedona, Arizona (Days 1–5)**
Sedona greeted us with warm air, endless sunshine, and that signature red-rock backdrop that makes every photo look like a postcard. We rented a car in Phoenix and made the easy two-hour drive north. The moment the rock formations came into view, we knew we were in for something special.

**Cathedral Rock and Bell Rock Hikes**
We started with a hike up Bell Rock, which is approachable for all ages and offers gorgeous views without too much strain. Later in the trip, we tackled the more challenging Cathedral Rock Trail — a short but steep climb that rewards you with breathtaking views at the saddle. Be ready to scramble a bit near the top!

**Chapel of the Holy Cross**
This architectural gem is built right into the red rocks and offers a peaceful place to reflect. Whether or not you're religious, the views from the chapel and the structure itself are worth the visit. It's an easy stop and great for all ages.

**Tlaquepaque Arts & Shopping Village**
When we needed a break from hiking, we spent an afternoon wandering the charming courtyards of Tlaquepaque, a Mexican-inspired arts and shopping village filled with galleries, cafes, and boutiques. We grabbed lunch at The Secret Garden Café and browsed local pottery and Southwest jewelry.

**Energy Vortexes and Scenic Drives**
Sedona is known for its spiritual vibe, and we couldn't resist visiting a few vortex sites — spots where the earth's energy is said to be especially strong. Whether or not you believe in the metaphysical, the surrounding nature is undeniably beautiful. Don't miss a drive up Red Rock Scenic Byway or Oak Creek Canyon for incredible roadside views.

**Where We Stayed**
We stayed at Arroyo Pinion Hotel, a mid-range boutique property with clean rooms, a heated outdoor pool, and easy access to Sedona's main attractions. It was a great base for exploring the area.

**Part 2: San Diego, California (Days 6–10)**
After soaking in Sedona's desert magic, we flew from Phoenix to San Diego for a complete change of pace. Within a few hours, we went from hiking canyons to walking along the Pacific Ocean. San Diego in April is a dream — sunny skies, blooming flowers, and perfect temperatures.

**San Diego Zoo**
Our first full day was spent at the world-famous San Diego Zoo. It lived up to the hype! Highlights included the pandas (on loan from China), the Skyfari aerial tram, and the playful otters. Wear good walking shoes — it's a full-day adventure.

**La Jolla and Coastal Exploring**
One afternoon, we headed to La Jolla Cove to watch sea lions sunbathe on the rocks. We followed that with a walk along the La Jolla Coastal Trail, which winds past tide pools and cliffside views. For lunch, The Cottage La Jolla was a hit with delicious California-style brunch fare.

**Balboa Park**
This expansive park is more than just gardens — it's a cultural hub. We visited the Fleet Science Center, which was great for kids, and strolled the Spanish-style architecture near the San Diego Museum of Art. There's something for everyone here, from puppet theaters to botanical gardens.

**Coronado Island**
A quick ferry or bridge ride brought us to Coronado, home of the iconic Hotel del Coronado. We didn't stay there, but we did spend a leisurely day walking the beach, exploring little shops, and enjoying sunset drinks by the water.

**Where We Stayed**
In San Diego, we stayed at Homewood Suites by Hilton San Diego Downtown/Bayside. It was family-friendly, walkable to Little Italy, and came with breakfast — always a win.

**Travel Tips for a Sedona-to-San Diego Trip**
- **Packing**: Bring layers! Sedona gets warm during the day but cool at night, while San Diego stays temperate but can get breezy by the coast.
- **Rental Cars**: A car is a must in Sedona but optional in San Diego if you're staying downtown. We returned our rental before flying and used rideshares in the city.
- **Timing**: April is a sweet spot for both locations — fewer crowds, perfect weather, and blooming wildflowers in Sedona.
- **Hiking Gear**: For Sedona, bring hiking shoes with grip, sunscreen, and a hydration pack or water bottle. Many trails are short but steep.

**Conclusion**
Our 10-day adventure from Sedona's red rock trails to San Diego's coastal charm was the perfect way to welcome spring. Each destination offered something unique — one grounded in desert peace and natural wonder, the other alive with culture, wildlife, and ocean air. If you're looking to combine nature, sunshine, and family-friendly fun into one unforgettable trip, this Southwest-meets-SoCal combo is hard to beat. Happy travels!
