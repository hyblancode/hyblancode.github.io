**Introduction**
When winter stretches into February and cabin fever starts to creep in, there's no better remedy than a peaceful weekend getaway. This past February, my family and I headed to the Cliff House in Ogunquit, Maine — a luxurious seaside resort perched dramatically on the cliffs above the Atlantic Ocean. While Ogunquit is a well-known summer destination, don't overlook its quiet, snow-dusted charm in the off-season. Here's a full recap of our relaxing and rejuvenating winter escape, with plenty of details to help you plan your own visit.

**Arrival and First Impressions**
As we pulled into the Cliff House driveway, snow flurries danced in the air and the ocean waves crashed below the icy cliffs. The resort's grand coastal architecture and warm lighting gave an immediate sense of comfort. Check-in was smooth and welcoming, and we were quickly settled into a room with sweeping views of the Atlantic — even more dramatic in winter, with slate-colored skies and frothy waves.

**Resort Amenities and Spa Bliss**
The Cliff House truly shines in the winter months thanks to its cozy, full-service amenities. The heated indoor pool, flanked by floor-to-ceiling windows, offered a serene spot to watch the snowfall while the kids splashed around. Meanwhile, I took full advantage of the spa. The deep tissue massage followed by time in the eucalyptus steam room left me completely relaxed — a true winter luxury.

We also enjoyed the fire pit areas throughout the resort, which are stocked with warm blankets and s'mores kits. Roasting marshmallows in winter coats while listening to the distant ocean was a memory we won't forget.

**Dining at The Cliff House**
We dined at The Tiller, the resort's signature restaurant, both nights of our stay — and for good reason. The setting alone, with dramatic oceanfront views, made it special, but the food was truly excellent. Highlights included the Maine scallops with brown butter and the creamy lobster bisque. For breakfast, their blueberry pancakes and smoked salmon toast were hits with the whole family.

If you're looking for a casual bite or drink, the Nubb's Lobster Shack (open limited hours in winter) offers a rustic, cozy vibe with plenty of Maine classics. Be sure to check availability as winter hours can vary.

**Exploring Ogunquit in Winter**
Though many of Ogunquit's seasonal shops are closed in February, there's still charm to be found. We took a crisp, bracing walk along the Marginal Way, the town's famous coastal path. Snow blanketed the rocky shoreline, and the waves crashed below — a completely different but equally beautiful scene from the summer strolls we've taken in the past.

We also visited Perkins Cove, which had a few spots open for coffee and browsing. The slower pace let us appreciate the peacefulness of this normally bustling area.

**Day Trip to Kennebunkport**
On Saturday afternoon, we took a short drive up the coast to Kennebunkport, another charming town with a little more off-season activity. We wandered through quaint shops, enjoyed a coffee at Dock Square Coffee House, and warmed up with clam chowder at Alisson's Restaurant, a local favorite. It was a nice little detour and gave us a broader sense of southern Maine's winter appeal.

**Travel Tips for the Cliff House in Winter**
- **Book Early**: Even in winter, the Cliff House is a popular destination for couples and families alike. Booking ahead ensures you get a room with the best views.
- **Dress Warmly**: The ocean winds can be intense, so bring a solid winter coat, hat, and gloves, especially if you plan to walk Marginal Way or explore Perkins Cove.
- **Spa Reservations**: Make your spa appointments early. Weekend slots fill up fast, especially for massages.
- **Dining Reservations**: The Tiller is a must, but winter hours may mean limited seating. Reserve in advance if you're staying over a weekend.

**Conclusion**
Our February weekend at the Cliff House in Ogunquit was exactly what we needed — a peaceful escape filled with cozy moments, winter ocean views, and top-notch hospitality. While Maine is best known for its summer tourism, I highly recommend experiencing its quieter, contemplative winter beauty. Whether you're snuggled up by the fire or watching the waves roll in from the spa, the Cliff House delivers coastal comfort in every season. Happy winter travels!
