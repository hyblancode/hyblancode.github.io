**Introduction**
There's nothing quite like a classic Maine summer day — ocean breezes, rocky shores, and the distant call of seagulls. This past July, we set out for a simple but unforgettable day trip to Nubble Lighthouse in York, Maine, one of the most photographed lighthouses in the country. Perched on a tiny rocky island just off Cape Neddick, the lighthouse offers everything you want from a Maine coastal outing: scenic views, salty air, and small-town charm. It's the kind of place where you can do as much or as little as you want — and that's exactly what we needed.

**Getting There and First Impressions**
Located just over the New Hampshire border, York is an easy drive from the Seacoast and southern New England. We arrived at Sohier Park, the viewing area for Nubble Light, in the late morning. Parking was easy to find, and best of all, it's completely free. As soon as we stepped out of the car, we were met with the sight of the iconic white lighthouse, its red-roofed keeper's house, and waves crashing against the island below. It's postcard-perfect — and yes, it really does look that good in person.

**Exploring Sohier Park**
While you can't actually walk to the lighthouse itself (it's on a small island just offshore), Sohier Park provides the best possible views. There are benches, grassy spots for picnicking, and plenty of rocky outcroppings where kids (and adventurous adults) can climb and explore. We spent a while just taking it all in — snapping photos, watching the lobster boats go by, and scanning the horizon for seals (no luck this time, but we've seen them here before!).

There's also a small gift shop and information center that's worth popping into. It offers local history, lighthouse trivia, and plenty of souvenirs if you want a keepsake to remember your visit.

**Picnic and Ice Cream**
We brought a packed picnic and found a shady spot on the grass near the edge of the rocks. The cool ocean breeze made it comfortable even in the midday sun. After lunch, we headed down the road to Dunne's Ice Cream, a local favorite known for generous portions and classic flavors. A scoop of Maine blueberry on a waffle cone was the perfect summer treat.

**Short Drive to York Beach**
Since we were already in the area, we made a quick detour to Short Sands Beach, just a few minutes away. It was buzzing with summer energy — families playing in the surf, the smell of fried dough wafting through the air, and the sound of arcade games spilling out of Fun-O-Rama, a nostalgic beachfront arcade. We dipped our toes in the water, strolled along the shoreline, and enjoyed the festive beach-town vibe before heading back.

**Travel Tips for Visiting Nubble Lighthouse**
- **Timing**: Arrive early if you want a quieter experience or come in the late afternoon for golden hour views. Midday in July can be busy, but there's usually still space to park.
- **What to Bring**: Sunscreen, water, a picnic blanket, and a camera. The breeze can be strong, so a light jacket might come in handy even in summer.
- **Restrooms**: Public restrooms are available near the parking area — clean and convenient.
- **Accessibility**: The main viewing area is fully accessible, with paved walkways and benches for sitting. The rocks are fun to explore but require careful footing.
- **Nearby Eats**: Don't miss Dunne's Ice Cream, and if you're looking for seafood, Fox's Lobster House is located right next to the lighthouse and offers beautiful water views.

**Conclusion**
Our July day trip to York's Nubble Lighthouse was the definition of summer simplicity — easy, beautiful, and soul-refreshing. There's something timeless about watching the waves roll in while a lighthouse stands steady against the sea. Whether you're a first-time visitor or returning for the hundredth time, Nubble Light delivers that quintessential Maine experience every single time. If you're craving coastal charm and an ocean breeze, put this iconic spot on your summer must-visit list. Happy adventuring!
