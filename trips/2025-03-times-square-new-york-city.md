**Introduction**
After a long New England winter, our family was craving big-city energy, bright lights, and an itinerary packed with iconic experiences. So in March 2025, we traded Boston's snow piles for Times Square's towering billboards and spent three exhilarating days in the heart of New York City. Staying steps from the action at the Marriott Marquis gave us a front-row seat to the electric pulse of Midtown. Here's how we squeezed Broadway magic, sky-high views, and memorable meals into a long weekend in the city that never sleeps.

**Arriving in the Heart of Times Square**
We took the early morning Amtrak from Boston's South Station, arriving at Moynihan Train Hall by late morning. From there, a quick taxi ride delivered us straight onto Seventh Avenue, where Times Square greeted us with its kaleidoscope of screens and street performers. The kids were mesmerized by the sheer scale of the plaza, and even after multiple visits, I couldn't help but feel giddy standing beneath the neon glow. We immediately ducked into the Times Square Visitor Center to pick up discount coupons and maps—handy for planning our whirlwind stay.

**Our Sky-High Base at the Marriott Marquis**
The Marriott Marquis rises right above the action, and checking in felt like entering our own sleek retreat above the bustle. Our high-floor room overlooked the TKTS steps and the digital canyon below, turning the windows into a living movie screen day and night. The hotel’s famous glass elevators gave us vertigo-inducing glimpses of the atrium every time we zipped up and down. We made the most of the Broadway Lounge for quick breakfasts with panoramic views, and one evening we rode up to the newly refreshed View Restaurant & Lounge to watch the city lights twinkle while we sipped mocktails.

**Broadway Dreams: The Great Gatsby**
The highlight of the trip was our night at the Broadway Theatre to see "The Great Gatsby." We booked matinee tickets to avoid keeping the kids out too late, and the Art Deco set design instantly transported us into the Roaring Twenties. The cast's powerhouse vocals, dazzling costumes, and immersive choreography kept us on the edge of our seats. Walking back to the hotel beneath the marquee lights, we couldn’t stop humming the show's finale and chatting about our favorite scenes. Pro tip: stop by the Marquis' concierge desk for last-minute ticket tips—they helped us snag great seats at face value.

**Iconic Midtown Moments**
With only three days, we focused on Midtown landmarks within walking distance. Early one morning we strolled to Rockefeller Center for tickets to Top of the Rock, timing our ascent for golden hour. The 360-degree views of the Empire State Building, Central Park, and the Hudson River were worth every chilly gust. We also explored the New York Public Library's majestic reading rooms, letting the kids complete the library's scavenger hunt before wandering through Bryant Park's winter village stalls for hot chocolate and warm pretzels.

**Interactive Fun for All Ages**
Times Square is a playground for pop culture lovers. We ducked into the new Museum of Broadway to trace the history of musical theater with hands-on exhibits, costume displays, and a replica backstage area that thrilled the kids. Nearby, the RiseNY experience whisked us through a short film about NYC's rise before strapping us into a soaring ride over city landmarks—a hit for thrill seekers. We balanced the high-octane attractions with a calmer afternoon at St. Patrick's Cathedral, lighting candles and admiring the stained glass.

**Tastes of the City**
Eating in Times Square can be a minefield of tourist traps, but we found plenty of delicious bites. For quick lunches, we relied on Urbanspace Vanderbilt’s food hall a short walk away, where everyone chose their own gourmet adventure. Dinner one night was at Carmine's, where family-style platters of chicken parmigiana and garlic bread disappeared in minutes. We grabbed bagels from Liberty Bagels for breakfast on the go, and no trip was complete without a stop at Junior’s for creamy New York cheesecake enjoyed back in our room while watching the bustle below.

**Travel Tips for Times Square**
- **Book Central Accommodations**: Staying at the Marriott Marquis kept us in the center of the action and made midday breaks with the kids easy.
- **Plan Attraction Timing**: Visit Top of the Rock early to beat the crowds, and schedule popular museums or immersive experiences with timed-entry tickets.
- **Leverage Public Transit**: A 7-day MetroCard covered our subway rides to nearby neighborhoods like Chelsea and the Upper West Side when we needed a change of scenery.
- **Fuel Up Smart**: Seek out nearby food halls and local favorites for meals—reservations for pre-theater dinners go fast.

**Conclusion**
Our March escape to Times Square delivered everything we hoped for: Broadway brilliance, skyline views, and the contagious energy of New York City. Staying at the Marriott Marquis gave us a comfortable home base amid the excitement, while thoughtful planning ensured we packed each day with memorable experiences without feeling rushed. Whether you're a first-time visitor or a seasoned NYC traveler, a few days in Times Square is the perfect antidote to late-winter blues. See you under the neon lights!
