**Introduction**
There's something deeply satisfying about spending a summer day outdoors, hands stained with berry juice and a basket full of fresh-picked fruit. This past July, we set out for a classic New England experience: blueberry picking at Butternut Farm in Farmington, New Hampshire. Nestled in the rolling countryside just outside the Lakes Region, Butternut Farm offers not just fields of delicious fruit but a wholesome, peaceful setting that's perfect for families, foodies, or anyone looking to slow down and savor summer's simple pleasures.

**Getting There and First Impressions**
Located about 45 minutes from the Seacoast, Butternut Farm is an easy drive through scenic backroads and quiet farmlands. We arrived mid-morning and followed the signs up a gravel driveway to a large parking area next to the farm store. Even from the lot, the views are stunning — rows of berry bushes, apple trees in the distance, and a peaceful farm pond tucked into the landscape. It's the kind of place that makes you take a deep breath and smile.

At check-in, friendly staff greeted us with picking buckets, gave a quick overview of the day's ripe fields, and pointed us toward the blueberry rows, which were in perfect season. The farm uses a simple, honest approach — pick what you like, pay by the pound, and enjoy the experience.

**Blueberry Picking**
We made our way to the blueberry fields, where plump, deep-blue berries hung heavily from the bushes. It didn't take long to fill our buckets — or our mouths. The kids had a blast searching for "the biggest one" and sneaking tastes along the way. The rows were wide and well-maintained, making it easy to maneuver even with little ones in tow. There were shaded spots between the bushes, and the July breeze kept things comfortable despite the sun.

Blueberry season at Butternut Farm typically peaks in mid-to-late July, and we hit it just right. The berries were sweet, abundant, and perfect for snacking, baking, or freezing for later.

**Exploring the Farm**
After picking, we took some time to explore the rest of the farm. Butternut is a working orchard, and though the apples won't be ready until fall, the trees were full and green, promising a great harvest to come. We also stopped by the farm pond, where frogs and dragonflies provided entertainment for the kids, and we sat under a tree to cool off.

Near the store, there's a small animal pen where goats and chickens peek out to greet visitors — a fun surprise that added to the charm of the visit. It's not a petting zoo, but you can get close enough to admire (and say hello to) the resident farm animals.

**Farm Store and Treats**
The farm store was our last stop — and one of the best. It's stocked with local goodies: jams, baked goods, cider donuts, and pre-picked fruit if you're short on time. We grabbed a pint of cold apple cider and a box of homemade blueberry muffins that barely made it to the car. If you're lucky, they'll also have fresh pies available — the blueberry and apple are both crowd-pleasers.

There's also a self-serve freezer with ice cream sandwiches and fruit pops — perfect for a quick cool-down before hitting the road.

**Travel Tips for Butternut Farm**
- **Timing**: Arrive early in the day for the best picking conditions and to beat the heat. Check the farm's website or Facebook page for daily updates on crop availability.
- **What to Bring**: Sunscreen, a hat, and water — the fields are sunny, and you'll be out in the open for a while. Buckets and containers are provided.
- **Footwear**: Wear comfortable shoes you don't mind getting dusty. The fields are grassy and flat but can be uneven.
- **Payment**: The farm accepts cash, card, and contactless payments. Fruit is sold by weight, so pick as much (or as little) as you like.
- **Restrooms**: Portable toilets are available near the parking area, and there are hand-washing stations too.

**Conclusion**
Our July day trip to Butternut Farm was the perfect blend of fresh air, fun, and flavor. It's the kind of outing that reminds you how rewarding it is to connect with where your food comes from — and how joyful it can be to spend a few hours unplugged and outside. Whether you're gathering fruit for pie, filling the freezer, or just enjoying a quiet day in the country, Butternut Farm offers a slice of summer at its sweetest. Happy picking!
