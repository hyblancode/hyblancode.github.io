**Introduction**
Some hikes are about pushing yourself. Others are about chasing a view. And then there are hikes like Welch-Dickey Loop in Thornton, New Hampshire — a near-perfect blend of both. This past November, we set out for a chilly but invigorating day trip to tackle this scenic White Mountains classic. With its open ledges, sweeping vistas, and just enough scrambling to feel like an adventure, the Welch-Dickey Loop delivered exactly what we were craving: fresh air, quiet trails, and a serious payoff at the summit.

If you've never hiked in the Whites during late fall, don't underestimate it — or overlook it. The crowds are gone, the air is crisp, and while the foliage has passed its peak, what remains is a landscape stripped down to its raw, dramatic beauty. This hike gave us all of that and more.

**Getting There and Trailhead Info**
The trailhead is tucked off Upper Mad River Road in Thornton, not far from Waterville Valley. It's easily accessible from I-93 (Exit 28), and the parking lot is clearly marked. We arrived around 9 a.m. to just a handful of cars — a big difference from the packed trailhead you'd find in peak foliage season.

There's a $5 day-use fee (bring cash or a recreation pass), and a kiosk with maps and trail info. The loop is just under 4.5 miles, and we planned on 3–4 hours total, including time to linger at the views. With a cool breeze and overcast skies, we layered up — gloves, hats, and light jackets — but the steady uphill climb warmed us up quickly.

**Up Welch Mountain: Ledges and Light**
The loop can be done in either direction, but we followed the common clockwise route, heading up Welch Mountain first. The trail starts in the woods with gentle switchbacks and gradually becomes steeper and rockier. Not long into the hike, the views begin — first through the bare trees, then from wide, open ledges that seem to appear out of nowhere.

Welch Mountain is the smaller of the two peaks, but don't let that fool you — the exposed rock faces offer stunning views across the Sandwich Range and beyond. In November, the landscape was a mix of deep greens, rust-colored underbrush, and the grays and whites of exposed granite and early frost. The contrast made for dramatic photos, even without the flash of fall leaves.

The ledgy sections require careful footing, especially when damp or icy, and we were glad to have worn hiking boots with solid grip. There were patches of frost in the shaded spots, a reminder that winter is never far off up here.

**Crossing the Ridge to Dickey Mountain**
After enjoying the wide summit views on Welch, the trail dips briefly before rising again to Dickey Mountain. This section of the hike feels like a true alpine experience — climbing across granite slabs, skirting pine-covered ridges, and catching long views of distant peaks at every turn.

We paused for a break at the top of Dickey, where the summit ledge offers panoramic views of Franconia Notch, the Kancamagus, and even Mount Washington on a clear day. We didn't have perfect blue skies, but the layered cloud cover added its own moody beauty. And the best part? We had the summit all to ourselves.

The descent winds back into the forest and is a bit longer than the ascent, but gentler and well-marked. It was the kind of peaceful downhill where your legs feel just tired enough and your head starts to clear out all the noise of everyday life. We emerged back at the trailhead around 1 p.m., ready for a warm meal and already talking about coming back in the spring.

**Post-Hike Lunch Stop**
For food, we headed just a short drive down to Mad River Coffee House in Campton. It's a cozy spot with fresh sandwiches, hot soups, and strong coffee — exactly what we needed. If you're in the mood for something heartier, Woodstock Inn Station & Brewery is also nearby and makes a great spot to warm up and refuel after a day on the trail.

**Travel Tips for Hiking Welch-Dickey in November**
- **Gear Up**: Wear sturdy boots with good traction, and bring layers — even if it feels mild at the start, the upper ledges can be windy and cold.
- **Watch the Weather**: November can mean icy patches, especially on exposed ledges. If snow is in the forecast or it rained the night before, conditions may be slick.
- **Parking Fee**: Don't forget the $5 fee or a White Mountain recreation pass. No cell service at the trailhead, so prep ahead.
- **Timing**: Start early, especially as daylight hours are shorter in the fall. We were glad to be off the trail by early afternoon.
- **Trail Direction**: Clockwise (Welch first) is the more popular direction — better footing for the steepest ledges on the way up, rather than down.

**Conclusion**
Our November hike of the Welch-Dickey Loop reminded us why this trail is such a favorite — short enough to do in half a day, challenging enough to feel like an accomplishment, and rewarding from start to finish. With cooler temps and fewer hikers, fall is a fantastic time to experience this loop in a whole new light. If you're looking for dramatic views, crisp mountain air, and a quiet place to clear your head, Welch-Dickey delivers — even after the leaves have fallen. Happy hiking!
